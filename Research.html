        <h3>The Guardian</h3>
        The Guardian has historically been praised for its investigative journalism,
        its dispassionate discussion of issues, its literary and artistic coverage
        and criticism, and its foreign correspondence. The Guardianâ€™s editorial
        stance is considered less conservative than that of The Daily Telegraph and
        The Times, its main London competitors, but its reporting is also marked by
        its independence.
